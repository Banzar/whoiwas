<ol>
	<li>Click on "New Legacy" link to create your new legacy. - This link will only be available to click if you have an unused legacy.</li>
	<li>Using the form that is displayed, enter the <strong>Name</strong>, a <strong>Photo</strong>, <strong>Birth Day</strong>, <strong>Passed On</strong> date, <strong>State</strong>, <strong>County</strong>, <strong>City</strong>, and under the <strong>About</strong> you will enter information that will describe who your legacy was. In many cases, this can just be their obituary. You may want to use their obituary and other information that you feel is relevant to describe who the legacy was.</li>
	<li>Click the <button>Create Legacy</button></li>
	<li>At this point, you will be directed to the legacy file you just created.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you are on your legacy files page, you will see a QR Code on the left side, underneath where the photo and information is. This is the image that has to be printed to add to a headstone or memorial. It is best to laminate these if you are printing it yourself.</p>
